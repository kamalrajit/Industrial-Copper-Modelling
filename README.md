# Industrial-Copper-Modelling

The copper industry deals with sophisticated sales and price data that have problems such as skewness and noisy data, which can reduce the precision of manual predictions. By utilizing techniques like data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, as well as algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data, machine learning algorithms can address time-consuming problems. A Classification model is constructed to forecast the status as Won or Lost, depending on other variables, while a Regression model is built to predict Sales.
